    "This task aimed to classify new emails as spam or ham using Bayes Theorem and a set of pre-classified emails. The Naive Bayes formula assumes that each element is independent, and in this case, it assesses each word as an individual based on its occurrence in the training data. This spam filter will not account for phrases common to spam emails. This makes the filter less accurate but is much more efficient as accounting for every combination of words that could be in an email would become exponentially more complex.<br>\n",
    "Formula used:<br>\n",
    "$P(email|S) = (P(S) * P(word1|S) * P(word2|S)) / (P(S) * P(word1|S) * P(word2|S) + P(H) * P(word1|H) * P(word2|H))$\n",

    "To complete this task, I created the following functions.<br>\n",
    "**Analyse_emails:** This function accepted a list of emails represented as strings as an argument. It then broke this list of emails into a list of all the words in the emails. These words were set to lowercase to ensure that words were not identified as being unique base on capitalisation. This list of words was then converted to a set to produce a list of unique words. The list of unique words and the list of all words were then used to calculate the probability of occurrence of each word. This was then added to a dictionary with the word as the key and the probability as its value. The total number of words was then added to this dictionary as totat_words to be used in calculations later to classify emails. The function returned a dictionary containing the probability of each word that occurred in the list of emails and the total number of words in the list of emails.<br>\n",
    "**Prior_probability:** This function calculated P(S) and P(H). It took two lists of emails as arguments and would return the number of emails in the first list over the total number of emails.<br>\n",
    "**Probability_of_A_given_B:** This function was used to analyse an email as either spam or ham, depending on the training data. It used the analyse_email function to calculate a dictionary of probabilities from the training data. This was then compared to the words in the email to get the likelihood of the email being spam or ham. If a word was not in the training data, Laplace smoothing was used to minimise its effect on the result.<br>\n",
    "**get_percentage:** Probability_of_A_given_B only calculates the numerator of the Naïve Bayes formula as this is all that is needed to evaluate if an email is spam or ham as the denominator for spam and ham is always equal. However, this resulted in tiny numbers, which didn't inspire me with confidence that my calculations were correct. This function converted the probabilities calculated in Probability_of_A_given_B to a form that is easier to read by adding the denominator and representing the value as a percentage.<br>\n",
    "**Update_training_data:** Once an email has been classified as spam or ham, this function adds it to the training data as spam or ham.<br>\n",
    "**Classify_email:** This function uses the functions prior_probability, probability_of_A_given_B, and get_percentage to evaluate an email and classify it as spam or ham. Information about the email is returned as a dictionary containing the probability of the email being spam or ham and a Boolean value that, when True, classifies the email as spam.<br><br>\n",
    "My code was tested by running all the new emails through my classify_email function. One email was misclassified as ham, which matched my calculations for this task. This was due to the number of unknown words in the email. This is because for the email 'renew your vows', and two words appear in the ham training data while only one appears in the spam training data. <br>\n",
    "The test was then repeated; however, the training data was updated after each classification. This time all emails were classified correctly. It can be seen that the certainty of an email being spam or ham increases as the test progresses.<br><br>\n",
    "**Updates based on other student's code**<br>\n",
    "Another student suggested that I add code that converts the words in the emails being processed to lowercase. This fixed a bug where words would be considered different from each other based on their capitalisation. After this code was added, an email that had previously been classified as spam was classified as ham. Because of this, the word 'Your' in one of the previous ham emails was considered a different word to 'your' in the tested email.<br>\n",
    "It was also suggested by another student to add stemming to my email classifier by adding a list of words that the classifer could ignore. This is a great idea, and stemming would be of benefit when creating an actual email classifier. However, for this task, I felt there were so few words in the training data that removing words wouldn't provide any benefit.<br><br>\n",
    "**Problems with this implementation.**<br>\n",
    "This implementation would need a large set of training data for it to work correctly. When there are many unknown words, an email could get incorrectly classified, which would then add incorrect data t the training data. Another way to fix this is that a user can move emails they consider spam to a spam email folder correcting any mistake made by the algorithm.\n"
